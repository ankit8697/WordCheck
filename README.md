# WordCheck
An Apps Script for Google Docs that counts the number of words in a predefined section.

### How to Use

Add `$count` at the beginning and end of a section you would like to count. Make sure these are on new lines to prevent your content from being overwritten. Once you do this, use the WordCheck dropdown menu to count either words or characters.
